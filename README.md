## Architecture overview

This reference application is cross-platform at the server and client-side, thanks to .NET 6 services capable of running on Linux or Windows containers depending on your Docker host. The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own database/cache) and implementing different approaches within each microservice (simple CRUD or DDD/CQRS patterns) using HTTP as the communication protocol between the client apps and the microservices.
